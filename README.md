# DA-401

In this project, I am investigating our ability to predict the number of overdoses in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania through a time series analysis of overdose EMS data. Currently, we have a KNN model working (to some degree) and this repository is used to hold the code, date, and preliminary results as we progress through the project.

In the code file found in this repo, the commented-out code details the methods used to work with the data and get it into the usable training/testing format we will use for KNN analysis. This code is left in for reference, however due to runtime of the code it was much more effective to save the training/testing data as seperate csv files and just load those in for future analysis. Unfortunately, due to the size of the training data, it is unable to be uploaded onto GitHub. The full dataset can be found [here]([url](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/allegheny-county-911-dispatches-ems-and-fire)). 

Also, some older methods of analysis/graphing are included as they may be useful to reference again throughout the project. Just because they are not useful now does not mean they cannot be useful in the future.

# DA-401
This repository is for the storage of code, data, and other related materials for the DA 401 project.
In this project, I am investigating our ability to predict the number of overdoses in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania through a time series analysis of overdose EMS data. Currently, we have a KNN model working (to some degree) and this repository is used to hold the code, date, and preliminary results as we progress through the project.
